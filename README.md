# Minecraft Speedrun Plugin

This plugin is a mini-game speedrun developed for Minecraft. It was designed and developed by Simon Delcuze, Albin Vanden-Broeck, and Louis Truptil. The game starts with a random selection of a target item. The first player to obtain this item wins the race. PvP is allowed, and all tricks are fair game to win.
